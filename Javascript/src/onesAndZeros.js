/*

Given an array of ones and zeroes, convert the equivalent binary value to an integer.

Eg: [0, 0, 0, 1] is treated as 0001 which is the binary representation of 1.

Examples:

Testing: [0, 0, 0, 1] ==> 1
Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
Testing: [0, 1, 0, 1] ==> 5
Testing: [1, 0, 0, 1] ==> 9
Testing: [0, 0, 1, 0] ==> 2
Testing: [0, 1, 1, 0] ==> 6
Testing: [1, 1, 1, 1] ==> 15
Testing: [1, 0, 1, 1] ==> 11
However, the arrays can have varying lengths, not just limited to 4.

// reverse the array to align powers of 2 to index
const binaryArrayToNumber = arr => {
  return arr.reverse()
            .map( (e, i) => e * Math.pow(2, i) )
            .reduce( (acc, e) => acc + e, 0);
};
